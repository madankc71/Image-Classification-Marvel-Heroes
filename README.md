# MarvelHeroesClassification

This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)Deep Learning model built in PyTorch. The model classifies 20 different marvel hero characters.

The dataset was created from 18,000 google images which has approximately similar amount of each 20 characters. 

The data cleansing was done by removing the multi-face images using MTCNN in google collab.

The accuracy of the CNN model is 71%.
